Projects
All the projects showcased here were developed solely by me. During their development, collaboration was required due to university guidelines, which mandated private repositories to prevent code copying between students. However, now that the projects are complete, they are publicly accessible.

For each project, you can find dedicated documentation that describes the technologies, concepts, and tools used.
